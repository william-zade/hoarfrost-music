        <p><h1>12 Tone Equal Tempermant and the Chromatic Scale</h1></p>

        <p><strong>What is this?</strong></p>
            <p>In western music we use what we call the 12 note even temperament system for writing and performing music.  Essentially we take a tone at a given pitch, and then half the pitch, and those two tones are called an octave.  They will have a very consonant sound to them as they are the same frequency.  We then divide the pitches between those two notes into 12 equal sections, including one of our original tones.  To help distinguish each of these notes we assign each one of them a letter name.  This is our 12 Note Even Temperament Music System.  The 12 notes look like the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>A</li>
                    <li>A#/Bb</li>
                    <li>B</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C#/Db</li>
                    <li>D</li>
                    <li>D#/Eb</li>
                    <li>E</li>
                    <li>F</li>
                    <li>F#/Gb</li>
                    <li>G</li>
                    <li>G#/Ab</li>
                </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p>This is a simple way of looking at our 12 tone even temperament system. Every note is a half-tone (sometimes referred to as half-step) apart. However this doesn't explain the relationships between the notes. The relationships between notes are sometimes called their 'intervalic relationships.' While knowing that term is cool, it doesn't mean much without the working knowledge of what that actually means. Below is a chart that explains those relationships.  You're going to learn some new terminology with this, but its ok, they get kinda intuitive after you get them under your fingers for a bit.</p>
        
        <!--build and put an intervalic relationship chart here-->

        <p>Each relationship or interval has a specific sound and feel to it, how we can emotionally interpret them. Understanding how a set of notes makes you feel is WAY more important than knowing what that relationship or value is called. Below we are going to talk a little bit about how each one of those sounds, list some places you have heard them before, and easy ways to remember how they sound and feel.</p>
