            <p>Welcome to Hoarfrost Music! We hope that what follows help you develop your own musical and artistic journey.  Music has a way to transform the human experience and make it more. It is our sincere desire to help make your experience more, so that we all may be better for it.</p>

            <p>Below is a guideline for learning music theory, songwriting, and making music.  While starting at the beginning and going all the way to the end is a great way to go through and learn, there are tons of resources within the course that we think you will find usable.  It is the intention to be able to skip back and forth as you need, to match your interest and current songwriting level or requirement. The idea isn't to sit on a pedastal dictating how the theory is supposed to be and how to go from noob to pro, but more like a cooperative experience designed to inspire you to create your best art. We firmly believe here that it does not take the next Mozart to shake the musical world, how boring would that be?!</p>
