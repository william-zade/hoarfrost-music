        <p><h1>Chords and Progressions</h1></p>
        <p><h3>So What The Hell are Chords Anyways, and why should I care?</h3></p>

        <p>That is a great question, and simply put a chord is any series of two or more notes played together so that they are heard at the same time. A little deeper importance to them would be to say that it is the progression of chords that provide the structure and framework of nearly every song in western music, and most other music around the world too. This is not the same as melody, but we will cover that in a little bit, as they are closely related.</p>
        <p>This is where we start putting to use our knowledge of intervals. For now we are going to keep things pretty simple, but it will make a lot more sense as we become more familiar with theory.  Especially when we get to the Major Scale, this will make how we get certain chords in a given progression make sense. Most of the chords we are going to use are going to follow a structure, and it is pretty easy to get.</p>
        <p>To make a chord, we need a root note, a 3rd, and a 5th. Yes there are exceptions, but we are going to keep this simple at first. A root note is going to be the basis for our chord, it's the note that is going to give the chord it's name. For example, if I said we are playing a C major chord, the root note is a C. For the majority of western music, especially common genres like pop, country, rock and metal, we are going to just use a couple chord types: Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented, and Sustained.</p>

        <!--build a chord structure chart and place here-->

        <p>A major chord has a bit of a happy, upbeat sound to it. Generally associated with feeling happy.  To make a major chord we use a root, major 3rd, and a perfect 5th. Example, a C major chord has a C, E, and G in it. C is our root, a major 3rd away from C is E, and a perfect 5th from C is G. What is cool is that it doesn't matter what order we play them in, which note is on the low end or high end, those three notes played in any order will always intone a C major chord.  Play it as E, G, C, and it's a C major.  G, E, C, still a C major.  E, C, G...you get the idea.  This is great because it gives us room for writing melodies and still getting the chord tone we want with our song and chord progression.</p>

        <!--maybe build a chord chart with all the major chords and their notes, place it here-->
        
        <p>A minor chord while very similar in structure to a major chord has a very different feel. Minor chords sound more sad, down, or melancholic. To get a minor chord we pick a root note, it's minor 3rd, and its perfect 5th. We are going to introduce a new term here, flatting the 3rd. Whenever we flatten something, it just means that we are taking a known interval, usually in a chord or a scale, and making it one tone flat. In this instance, to get a minor chord, we take that major chord, go to it's 3rd, and make it flat.  Let's use our C major again for reference. Before we used a C (root), E (major 3rd), and G (perfect 5th). So, to make a C Minor chord then, we are going to go to that major 3rd, E, and flatten it one half tone to a minor 3rd. Here that would be E flat, often annotated as Eb.  Now our chord looks like C, Eb, G. The 3rd is the only thing that changed structure wise, but the feel changed completely.  Again, it doesn't matter what order you play them in, those three notes are always going to make a C Minor Chord.</p>

        <!--build a minor chord chart for all twelve minor chords and put here-->

        <p>Diminished chords are kinda special. They have a sound that is kinda difficult to define, but once you hear it you know exactly what it is. 
        <!--get a better description of a diminished chord here and expand on its tonal qualities-->
        To build a diminished chord we are going to build a minor chord, and then flatten the 5th. So we will have our root note, a minor 3rd, and a flat 5th. Going back to our C chord example, let's go ahead and build our C minor. We have our root C, our minor 3rd Eb, and our perfect 5th G. Now, we are going to make the G a Gb.  Our C diminished now looks like C, Eb, Gb.</p>

        <!--build a diminished chord chart and insert here-->

        <p><strong>Right here is where we are going to make a break.</strong> Major, minor, and diminished chords are the three chord types that make up a Major Scale and all of it's modes. The next few types are going to round out our three note common chord types that you are going to find in a lot of popular music, but are not exclusively "dominant" chords.  More on that latter when we talk about scales.</p>

        <p>Augemented chords. What the heck are these, how do they sound, and how do we build them?</p>

        <p>Suspended chords.  We usually refer to two types, and those are sus2 and sus4 chords.  Essentially in both cases we are again modifying the 3rd, but this time by a whole tone or step. In a sus2 chord we are dropping our major 3rd a whole step down to a major 2nd. With sus4 chords we are making our major 3rd a perfect 4th. The feel is different between a sus2 and a sus4 chord, but they can both fill a similar function and act like a "passing chord", or a chord that takes you to the actual root chord you were shooting for.  This can add a lot of interest in a progression that may have been sounding a bit plain before. We are going to cover this at length when we get to Chord Progressions <!--make that a link to the Progressions page--></p>
